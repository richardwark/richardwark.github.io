# Packer Workshop - Exploring OCI

![](images/WorkshopHeader/200.png)

## Introduction

In this lab we will launch a compute instance to work from, installing packer and create an environment for  building your first, custom image of CentOS 7.  You will learn to securely connect to this compute image using secure shell and to create keys used to secure API calls.  You will also start to gain familiarity with Oracle Cloud Instrastructure's operation and security features.

***To log issues***, click here to go to the [ oracleGithub](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/issues/new) repository issue submission form. We look forward to your questions and suggestions for improvement.

## Objectives

- Launch Compute Image
- Install Packer
- Gather remaining OCIDs for Cloud objects

## Required Artifacts

- Oracle Cloud Account - (configured in Lab100)
- Your public ssh key from lab 100
- Variables.json file open

### **STEP 1**: Create an OCI Compute Instance

You will now create a CentOS-based Compute instance using the public key half of the key-pair you just generated.  We'll call this the Client Image in future labs.  It's a stand-in for your laptop or developement workstation since some attendee's might have issues installing on their laptop due to administrative controls.

**`NOTE: feel free to install packer and git on your laptop if you feel comfortable doing so...  If you've done so, skip directly to `** (Lab300.md)

- Go back to your OCI console and from the hamburger menu in the upper left hand corner 
select **Compute-->Instances**

    ![](images/Lab200/26.PNG)

- Click **Create Instance**

   ![](images/Lab200/26.1.PNG)

- **You will Select, Leave Default or Type** the following in the `Create Compute Instance` section of the dialog:


```
Name: packer-builder
Availability Domain: AD 1 (please Use default AD 1)
Boot Volume: Oracle-Provided OS Image
Image Operating System: CentOS7  <change to>
Shape Type: Virtual Machine (Default)
Shape: VM.Standard2.1 (Default)
SSH Keys: Choose SSH Key Files
```

- After entering the _packer-builder_ instance name click the **Change Image Source**.

  ![](images/Lab200/26.5.PNG)

- Select **CentsOS 7** and click **Select Image**.  This selection will now be shown on the page:

   ![](images/Lab200/27.png)


 
   ![](images/Lab200/27.1.png)

- Scroll down furthur on the page and select your PUBLIC SSH Key

**NOTE:** You will paste the public key you copied in Step 7 of lab 100 into the SSH KEY field by selecting the "Paste SSH Keys" radio button. `The public key should be pasted as a single line`

- You can either select your packerkey.pub from your filesystem or paste it

  ![](images/Lab200/28.1.png)

- In the Configure networking Section you will take ALL of the defaults as shown:

  ![](images/Lab200/29.1.png)

- Click **Create**

In less than one minute, you should see your instance provisioning and the Public IP Address.  While it's spinning up, you'll notice the OCID has been generated.  This can be used to refer to this image using the REST API should you want to.

  ![](images/Lab200/30.1.PNG)

- `Make a note of the Public IP Address as we will be using this in the next step.`

In about 2 1/2 minutes, you should see your instance in the running state, available to be reached via ssh.

   ![](images/Lab200/30.2.png)

### **STEP 2**: Connect via SSH into the Instance

The last set up piece will be to SSH into the Compute image and install packer and git.

#### **Windows:**
- For a Windows client launch Putty, select the **Session** section and type in the IP address:

   ![](images/Lab200/31.png)

- Select the **Data** section and enter the following as the username:

```
opc
```

- Yours should look like:

  ![](images/Lab200/32.png)

- Select **SSH-->Auth** and browse to the Private Key you created back in Step 7:

   ![](images/Lab200/33.png)

- Click the **Open** button. You will presented the first time with am alert message. Click **Yes**

   ![](images/Lab200/35.png)

- You will logged into the Compute image:

   ![](images/Lab200/36.png)

- **NOTE:** For Linux and Mac client sessions "cd" into the directory where your key pair is. Your packerkey file has the permissions of "600" or "rw---------".  The private key allows you to ssh into the compute instance `substituting your IP address`, which already has the public key we specified in the instance create...deployed to the opc user.

#### **Macs:**

Launch a terminal window and ssh to the packer-builder image
Example:

```
ssh -i ./packerkey opc@129.213.56.230
```

### **STEP 3**: Install and configure Packer and GIT

Packer and GIT are required for the subsuquent labs. You will install the Docker engine, enable it to start on re-boot, grant docker privledges to the `opc` user and finally install GIT.

- **Cut and Paste** the following in a terminal window:

```
sudo -s
yum -y install git
cd packer
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.4/packer_1.3.4_linux_amd64.zip
unzip packer_1.3.4_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin
exit
mkdir packer
mkdir ~/.oci
alias packer=/usr/local/bin/packer
echo "Complete"


```

- **Type** the following to verify good installations:

```
which packer
git status
```

### **STEP 4**: Gather remaining OCIDs

Collect your User's OCID and add the public key.

-  Navigate using the **hamburger menu** to Identity--> Users

   ![](images/Lab200/4.1.0.png)

- Copy the OCID from the non-federated User entry (the one without the oracleidentitycloudservice prefix)

- Paste this into your open variables.json file:

  ![](images/Lab200/4.1.1.png)

### **STEP 5**: Create public API key in .pem format

On the machine where you created your public SSL keypair, generate a second keypair, in .pem format.  This keypair will be used an API key.             

- Do this by running  by running the **openssl genrsa** command: 
```
openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/packer_api_key.pem 2048
```

   ![](images/Lab200/4.1.2.2.png)

That generated the private key.

- Confirm the format with:

   ![](images/Lab200/4.1.2.3.png)

```
more packer_api_keykey.pem 

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEA2IDeX26zm5isE/NRAtC1gKblqlYr78xWDh+lXiT2xOhhL8ek
.
.
.
b+rgkatErx/0Jc2QmYUFj9jRRAF1szKl2GHADBo3rjKOLye+oKMdLM4Z3wuaeuMR
/KeLJVXhIPEPaAf3BXqVOQtAVY/jh1lXkyn9gXUcs1vlzruhu1DvWA==
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----
```

- Next we generate the PUBLIC API key which we will add to our cloud user. To do so, we run the **openssl** command taking our private key and exporting an RSA formatted PUBLIC key

```
openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/.oci/packer_api_key.pem  -out ~/.oci/packer_api_key_public.pem
```

- Now, add the public key to the user you just grabbed the OCID for, pasting the created fingerprint to variables.json  

  - Select the User:

  ![](images/Lab200/4.1.2.png)
  
  - Select **Add Public Key**  and add the API key by pasting ALL LINES from packerkey.pem

  ![](images/Lab200/4.1.3.png)

  - You should see the fingerprint appear after **hitting "Add"**

  ![](images/Lab200/4.1.4.png)

  - Now, **Copy** the string after "Fingerprint:" into variables.json

  ![](images/Lab200/4.1.5.png)

This creates a trust relationship between the Cloud Account and the keypair deployed.  Now, with the private key from this keypair, the identity of a call with the User's OCID can be verified by the public key stored in OCI.

- After **pasting** the fingerprint to variable.json, It should now look similar to: 

    ![](images/Lab200/4.1.6.png)

- We now just need the OCID of the Tenancy and the Availability Domain

   - For The tenancy's OCID, navigate using the **hamburger menu** to Administration--> ***My Tenancy Details***  

   ![](images/Lab200/5.1.0.png)

   -  **Copy** the OCID and paste into variables.json

     ![](images/Lab200/5.1.1.png)

   -  Finally, **copy** your Availability Domain from the instances page (**hamburger menu** to "Compute"), it's listed on the lower left

     ![](images/Lab200/5.1.2.png)

     ![](images/Lab200/5.1.3.png)

- You should now have a completed variables file:

  ![](images/Lab200/5.1.4.png)

Now **commit** your work on that file to your repository.

  ![](images/Lab200/5.1.5.png)

**You are ready to proceed to [Lab 300](Lab300.md)**
